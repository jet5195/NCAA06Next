In this alternate_uniforms team folder, it is recommended to group the uniforms by year (eg. "2016-Current" or "1962 Throwbacks").

Within each folder there should be folders that correspond to what is in the team's root folder in replacements: Home, Away, _global, and _general. You can ignore the other alternate folders.

If the team uses a combination of multiple colors for their primary uniform kit, break them down by color as such:

-2016-Current
---Primary Black
------Home
------Away
------_general
------_global
---Primary Green
------Home
------Away
------_general
------_global
---Primary White
------Home
------Away
------_general
------_global


Otherwise, you can omit the colors folders... 

-1962 Throwbacks
----Home
----Away
----_general
----_global


The Home and Away folder should contain the same textures, but renamed appropriately to replace the textures in the team's Home and Away folders in replacements. That way, if a user wants to use, for example, white pants. They can copy the corresponding file from the home or away folder without having to rename any files. NOTE: We only need to do this for Home and Away. No need to do this for every Alternate #1, etc. To replace textures in the alternate slots, the user will need to rename the file.
